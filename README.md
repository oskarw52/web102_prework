## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
My biggest issue was using the javascript methods especially reduce. I kept getting an unexpected error that took me a while to figure out.
Because I did not provide initial value for doing any sum I, my sum kept being some arbitrary object ID. I thought that the issue was with the toLocaleString()
but adding initial value of 0 fixed the issue.
